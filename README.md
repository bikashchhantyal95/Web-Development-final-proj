# Web-Development-final-proj

I tried to craete DBContext in shared library but was unsecessfull. So, I create DBContext in api project.
I also wrote test cases tried to run but the test failed as I was not able to do it properly. I tried many ways to write test cases but failed.

# Final Check in
I tried to integrate api with clint side but only blogs were fetched. Other such as POST, CREATE, PUT, DELETE are not working though on the api it was working.
I also tried to implement Identity framework but encountered with errors.
I also wrote tests which were success and sone failed.
I also did try to implement authentication on api but was not able to.
Encountered error after createing Comment Model and update database.
